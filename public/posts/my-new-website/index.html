<p>I have had several failed attempts of a personal website/blog, they all looked terrible, I tried using php layouts, jekyll, plain HTML, etc&hellip; but the results weren&rsquo;t really nice for me :( (probably because I don&rsquo;t know how to use them appropriately), so I decided to give premade themes a try with  <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a>, so far so good, it&rsquo;s been working perfectly fine and it&rsquo;s certainly better than my themes, the theme the website uses right now is called <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/">hello-friend-ng</a>. It&rsquo;s pretty simple but I like it :D</p>
<h2 id="the-blog">The blog</h2>
<p>My blog is a place to express, give opinions and share thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>This is the first post of my blog, I plan to write at least one short post everyday talking about my day, feelings, what I learned, etc. This kind of journal will be a fun way to document my life and practice my redaction skills. All these posts will have the <a href="http://forero.ga/tags/daily/">daily tag</a></p>
<p>Additionally there will be less frecuent long posts about a topic in specific.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The end</h2>
<p>Thank you for reading my post, I hope you enjoyed and stay tunned!</p>

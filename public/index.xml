      <description>Day: 3 Date: Wednesday, August 26, 2021  This was just a normal day, I spent my day in online classes and homework.
I was going to have training but it was canceled because Bogotá had had public order problems. Instead I was supposed to do my own training, but I was really lazy so I decided to do something very very calm.</description>

      <description>Day: 2 Date: Wednesday, August 25, 2021  Today was a just a normal day, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have classes, although I used my free time to do some homework from school, I even redacted an essay about death penalty, I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy doing it.
Me and my family were thinking about getting me vaccinated but we finally decided that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do it yet, because I&amp;rsquo;m having an athletics competition really soon and I want to avoid side effects.</description>

      <description>Day: 1 Date: Tuesday, August 25, 2021  Dear readers, Today is the first day of my e-diary, a project that aims to document my life and share thoughts and ideas.
I woke up at around 6:40 in the morning, took a shower, brushed my teeth and started my virtual school day, I do not enjoy virtual classes anymore, I&amp;rsquo;m tired of them, I believe that 1.5+ years of virtual school is enough for me, I cannot wait to go to the irl school.</description>

      <description>Hello there, I&amp;rsquo;m glad you found my website, my small corner of the internet, you may be wondering what is this place, right? Well, this is my blog, yep, this is just another blog in the world wide web.
I have had several failed attempts of a personal website/blog, they all looked terrible, I tried using php layouts, jekyll, plain HTML, etc&amp;hellip; but the results weren&amp;rsquo;t really nice for me :( (probably because I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use them appropriately), so I decided to give premade themes a try with hugo, so far so good, it&amp;rsquo;s been working perfectly fine and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly better than my themes, the theme the website uses right now is called hello-friend-ng.</description>

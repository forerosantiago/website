<h2 id="what-is-tildeverse">What is tildeverse</h2>
<p><a href="tildeverse.org/">tildeverse</a> is an association of tilde communities. Tildes are shared computers where people can create an account and learn about operating systems and computers safely and for free!</p>
<p>Tildeverse provides some services to its users, it has a <a href="https://tilde.zone/about">mastodon instance</a>, <a href="https://tilde.chat/">irc network</a>, <a href="https://tildegit.org/">git server</a>, they even have a <a href="https://mc.tildeverse.org/">mc.minecraft server</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://tilde.chat/">tilde.chat</a> is the irc network for tildeverse, members usually chat via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">irc</a> or talk on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumble_(software)">mumble</a> server, there are lots of channels where you can talk about anything with a lot of friendly people.</p>
<h2 id="cool-how-do-i-join">Cool, how do I join?</h2>
<p>Tildeverse has several tilde members, so you&rsquo;d have to choose one and follow the sign up instructions, usually you&rsquo;d need to fill out a form with your email, username, ssh key and sometimes your password. Or email the admins, account creation usually takes a few days, because the user creation is a manual operation the admins have to make.</p>
<p>When you get a shell account in a tilde you usually get an email address, cool, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

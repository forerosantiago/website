- **Day:** 3
- **Date:** Wednesday, August 26, 2021

This was just a normal day, I spent my day in online classes and homework.

I was going to have training but it was canceled because Bogot√° had had public order problems. Instead I was supposed to do my own training, but I was really lazy so I decided to do something very very calm.

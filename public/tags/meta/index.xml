      <description>Hello there, I&amp;rsquo;m glad you found my website, my small corner of the internet, you may be wondering what is this place, right? Well, this is my blog, yep, this is just another blog in the world wide web.
I have had several failed attempts of a personal website/blog, they all looked terrible, I tried using php layouts, jekyll, plain HTML, etc&amp;hellip; but the results weren&amp;rsquo;t really nice for me :( (probably because I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use them appropriately), so I decided to give premade themes a try with hugo, so far so good, it&amp;rsquo;s been working perfectly fine and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly better than my themes, the theme the website uses right now is called hello-friend-ng.</description>

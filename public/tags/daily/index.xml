      <description>Day: 2 Date: Wednesday, August 25, 2021  Today was a just a normal day, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have classes, although I used my free time to do some homework from school, I even redacted an essay about death penalty, I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy doing it.
Me and my family were thinking about getting me vaccinated but we finally decided that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do it yet, because I&amp;rsquo;m having an athletics competition really soon and I want to avoid side effects.</description>

      <description>Day: 1 Date: Tuesday, August 25, 2021  Dear readers, Today is the first day of my e-diary, a project that aims to document my life and share thoughts and ideas.
I woke up at around 6:40 in the morning, took a shower, brushed my teeth and started my virtual school day, I do not enjoy virtual classes anymore, I&amp;rsquo;m tired of them, I believe that 1.5+ years of virtual school is enough for me, I cannot wait to go to the irl school.</description>

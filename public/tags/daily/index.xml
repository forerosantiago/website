      <description>Day: 1 Date: Tuesday, May 5, 2021  Dear readers, Today is the first day of my e-diary, a project that aims to document my life and share thoughts and ideas.
I woke up at around 6:40 in the morning, took a shower, brushed my teeth and started my virtual school day, I do not enjoy virtual classes anymore, I&amp;rsquo;m tired of them, I believe that 1.5+ years of virtual school is enough for me, I cannot wait to go to the irl school.</description>

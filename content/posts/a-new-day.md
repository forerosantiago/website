- **Day:** 2
- **Date:** Wednesday, August 25, 2021

Today was a just a normal day, I didn't have classes, although I used my free time to do some homework from school, I even redacted an essay about death penalty, I didn't enjoy doing it.

I also spent some time on my pc, I created a new linux user and started creating my dotfiles, they are available [here](https://github.com/forerosantiago/dotfiles) by the way.

In the afternoon I went with my sister to walk around the neighborhood, and finally at 7PM played in a chess tournament, I didn't do very well because I was tired.

Today I want to talk about my chess career today, so I started playing a lot of chess online during the pandemic, I really enjoy it and have improved by a lot, everything I learned a lot of stuff online, which made me a player who is better than the average person, I still consider myself a beginner though...

Recently like a week ago, I met a friend online who studies in the National University, he told me about a chess club, and I joined, which made me really happy. It was a little bit hard for me to be able to join since this program is for uni students, and I'm not there yet, however I told the teacher about my school (which belongs to the National University) and he let me in. I think this is a really nice opportunity to improve and meet new people.

At the moment of writing this I am really tired, so I apologize if there are any mistakes in this post. Thank you and have a nice day.

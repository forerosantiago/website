- **Day:** 1
- **Date:** Tuesday, May 5, 2021

Dear readers,
Today is the first day of my e-diary, a project that aims to document my life and share thoughts and ideas.

I woke up at around 6:40 in the morning, took a shower, brushed my teeth and started my virtual school day, I do not enjoy virtual classes anymore, I'm tired of them, I believe that 1.5+ years of virtual school is enough for me, I cannot wait to go to the irl school.

Until around 12PM my classes finally ended, I had my lunch and went to my athletics training (I'm getting started in the athletics world, and I'm already having a competition the saturday) from 3PM to 5PM, I believe it was the best part of my day.

I really enjoy doing athleticism and I think it's a really nice way to spend my time. Today was my second day training with **IDRD** (Instituto Distrital de Recreaci√≥n y Deporte) for free! Isn't it amazing? Today I worked on my running speed and practiced bit of javelin throwing, it isn't as hard as I thought it would be, but it still requires technique and concentration.

This is a little summary of my day, it was a normal day, nothing special, I did enjoy a lot today's training.

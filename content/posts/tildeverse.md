In today's article we are going to talk about ✨tildeverse ✨. 
## What is tildeverse
[tildeverse](tildeverse.org/) is an association of tilde communities. Tildes are shared computers where people can create an account and learn about operating systems and computers safely and for free!

Tildeverse provides some services to its users, it has a [mastodon instance](https://tilde.zone/about), [irc network](https://tilde.chat/), [git server](https://tildegit.org/), they even have a [mc.minecraft server](https://mc.tildeverse.org/).

[tilde.chat](https://tilde.chat/) is the irc network for tildeverse, members usually chat via [irc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) or talk on the [mumble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumble_(software)) server, there are lots of channels where you can talk about anything with a lot of friendly people.


## Cool, how do I join?
Tildeverse has several tilde members, so you'd have to choose one and follow the sign up instructions, usually you'd need to fill out a form with your email, username, ssh key and sometimes your password. Or email the admins, account creation usually takes a few days, because the user creation is a manual operation the admins have to make.

When you get a shell account in a tilde you usually get an email address, cool, isn't it?
